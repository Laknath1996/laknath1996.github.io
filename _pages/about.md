[Hello there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc)! I'm a 5th-year PhD candidate at the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Prof. [Joshua Vogelstein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DWPfdT4AAAAJ&hl=en), Prof. [Pratik Chaudhari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c_z5hWEAAAAJ&hl=en), and Prof. [Carey Priebe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=clTVC4UAAAAJ&hl=en). My Ph.D. research focuses on learning from non-stationary data, culminating in a mathematical framework called *[prospective learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00109)*. This work connects to ongoing efforts in continual learning and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.

Iâ€™m passionate about advancing AI through inventing novel models and algorithms with strong guarantees, and about using AI to accelerate progress in science and industry. My research interests include learning theory, computer vision, generative modeling, continual learning, OOD generalization, and reinforcement learning.

I obtained a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University in 2024. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2020.

Outside work, I love spending time with my wife [Malsha](https://malshav.github.io/), playing the piano, hiking, running, and swimming. I am also an avid history and astronomy enthusiast!
