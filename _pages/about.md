[Hello there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc)! I am a 5th-year PhD candidate at the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Prof. [Joshua Vogelstein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DWPfdT4AAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Pratik Chaudhari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c_z5hWEAAAAJ&hl=en) (UPenn).

I am passionate about the problem of learning in non-stationary environments where the distributions of data, the goals of the learner, and the optimal hypotheses may change over time. 
A significant portion of my doctoral research involved developing *[prospective learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00109)*, a first-principles mathematical framework that characterizes such problems.

I obtained my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University in 2024. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2020. I completed my undergraduate thesis on *"Designing a Cost-Effective Dry Contact sEMG Sensor System for Controlling a Bionic Hand"* with Dr. [Simon Kappel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HTFY3fsAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Thilina Lalitharatne](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0NvOK1kAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Outside work, I love spending time with my wife [Malsha](https://malshav.github.io/), playing the piano, hiking, and trying out new recipes. I am also an avid fan of history, astronomy, movies, and sports in general!
