        \begin{onecolentry}
            \begin{highlights}
                \item Developed \textit{prospective learning}, a first-principles mathematical framework that characterizes learning problems where the distributions of data, goals of the learner, and optimal hypotheses vary predictably over time.
                \item Designed and implemented \textit{prospective} neural networks that significantly outperformed continual and online learning approaches on task sequences with predictable dynamics.
                \item Extended prospective learning to sequential decision-making, and designed time-aware reinforcement learning algorithms that learn optimal foraging policies in non-stationary environments.
                \item Discovered a counterintuitive phenomenon in domain adaptation, where the target risk can behave non-monotonically with respect to the amount of source (out-of-distribution) data in the training dataset.
                \item Presented the work in top machine learning conferences, workshops, and journals (including NeurIPS, ICML, and TMLR), and won 2 best paper awards at AGI'25 and ECCV'22 workshop on OOD generalization in computer vision.
